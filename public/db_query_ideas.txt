1. distribution of brands between grocers (horizontal stacked bar)
  - want some grocers with only one or two brands
  - some brands should be limited to a few grocers
2. proportion of total savings lost, available, within stores of single grocer (nested pies? map?)
  - be more specific about expiration dates - skew them somehow
3. number of coupons set to expire within certain timeframes? number of active
   coupons over time?
4. most discounted products by brand?
